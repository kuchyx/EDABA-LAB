\chapter{Task 1 - Textual description of a database}
\section{Aim}

Football manager database in order to be able to simulate football manager game. \\ 
It needs to reflect realistically status, description, attributes of entities connected with football in order to ensure better simulation. \\ 


\section{Objects}  \label{Objects Section}
We have chosen to make 6 entities \\ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player - Football players who are involved in matches, are signed to clubs, are coached by specific manager, they are the most important entity in the database as they are base for the whole database to function properly. Their behavior needs to be simulated not only during games but also after and before games.\\
    skill value, position, reputation, contract status (is player loaned out from another club for example or maybe they do not have a club at all), injury status, age, wages, transfer value, 
    \item Club - budget (for wages, transfers), players assigned to club, manager assigned to club, competitions the club is taking part in, training ground quality, reputation, country of origin,
    \item Match - Clubs taking part in (from which we derivate manager and players), score, statistics (like shots on target), attendance, weather, duration (90 minutes or extended time), date, referee name
    \item Manager - skill value, reputation, age, wages
    \item Competition - list of matches, prize, country, reputation (importance of the tournament)\\
    (not tournament because tournament usually refers to like cup competitions not league ones)
    \item Stadium - venue assigned to a club where certain competitions and matches take place, hold information about maximum capacity, stadium reputation, location, year it was build, value of stadium, ticket price, 
\end{itemize}

players playing in matches \\
manager exchanged between clubs, manager signed to club, manager released from club, \\
